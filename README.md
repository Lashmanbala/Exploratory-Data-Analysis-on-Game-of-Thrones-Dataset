# GUVI-EDA-and-DATAPIPELINE-Project-on-Game-of-Thrones-Dataset

# Game of Thrones
Explore deaths and battles from this fantasy world

# Context
Game of Thrones is a hit fantasy tv show based on the equally famous book series "A Song of Fire
and Ice" by George RR Martin. The show is well known for its vastly complicated political landscape,
large number of characters, and its frequent character deaths.

# Content
Of course, it goes without saying that this dataset contains spoilers ;)
This dataset combines three sources of data, all of which are based on information from the book
series.
● Firstly, there is battles.csv which contains Chris Albon's "The
War of the Five Kings" Dataset. Its a
great collection of all of the battles in the series.
● Secondly we have character-deaths.csv from Erin Pierce and Ben
Kahle. This dataset was created as a part of their Bayesian Survival
Analysis.
● Finally we have a more comprehensive character dataset with
character-predictions.csv. It
includes their predictions on which character will die.

# Task
● With the Given dataset Extract the data from Csv file
● Explore the data with Visualization(EDA)
● Create Visualization for (Battle Type,attacker size,defender size, location
and Region of war and Finally Give story of which king wins the most )
● Transform the dataset using Pandas and Load the data into Cloud
database (AWS using Lambda, RDS, S3) with Data Pipeline.
