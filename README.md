# Extraction of data

The dataset has 3 csv files which have data regarding the Game of Thrones. The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle. I read the csv files using Pandas.

# Visualisation

Here I used Pyplot and Seaborn libraries to plot the charts.

Chart 1:

I crated a chart for Attacker_size of each King. Attecker size means, if a king goes to attack another kingdom, how big the size of the army he goes with. This chart shows on an average which king goes with bigger army.

Chart 2:

This chart is for Defender_size of the each king. Defender_size means, the size of the army when a king defends. This chart shows whose army size is bigger when it comes to defending.

chart 3:

There are different battle types. Pitched battle, Ambush battle, Siege battle, Razing battle. This chart shows the choise of battle type of each king.

Chart 4:

In Game of Thrones the battles were happend in 27 different locations. This chart shows how many battles happend in each location.

Chart 5:

In Game of Thrones the battles were happend in 7 different regions. This chart shows how many battles happend in each region.

Chart 6:

This chart shows how many battles each king participated in. And which king participated in more n.of battles.

Chart 7:

This chart shows the Number of wins and losses of each King had. And which king wins the most.

Finally I gave the story of which king wins the most.
